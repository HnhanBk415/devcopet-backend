# Default Arguments and Clean APIs

## Purpose and Use Case

This lesson is part of **Functions**.

Default arguments make common cases simple while still allowing customization.

The goal is not only to memorize syntax. The goal is to understand how this idea helps a beginner write clearer, safer, and more useful Python programs.

You will use this concept in small scripts, roadmap challenges, quiz questions, and later DSA lessons.

## Core Concept

The core idea of this lesson is **default arguments**.

In beginner Python, each concept should answer one question:

```text
What problem does this solve?
When should I use it?
What mistake should I avoid?
```

For this lesson, remember:

```text
Default arguments make functions easier to call.
```

## Technical Breakdown

Here is a basic example:

```python
def greet(name="learner"):
    print("Hello", name)

greet()
greet("Nova")
```

This example is intentionally small. Small examples make it easier to see what Python is doing.

When reading Python code, go line by line:

```text
1. Identify the data.
2. Identify the operation.
3. Predict the result.
4. Run the code and compare.
```

## Try it Yourself

Run the code, then change one value and run it again.

```python-run
def greet(name="learner"):
    print("Hello", name)

greet()
greet("Nova")
```

## Common Mistake

A common beginner mistake is using the syntax without understanding the purpose.

Before writing code, ask:

```text
What value am I working with?
What should happen next?
What output or result do I expect?
```

If the output is different from what you expected, read the code from top to bottom and check each value.

## Best Practices

Keep your code small while learning.

Use clear variable names.

Add readable output with `print()` when testing.

Run the program after every small change.

Do not ignore errors. Error messages are clues.

## Concept Summary

In this lesson, you learned the beginner foundation of **default arguments**.

Key takeaway:

```text
Default arguments make functions easier to call.
```

This concept will appear again in later practice, roadmap games, and larger Python programs.
